Michaela is a third-year graduate student in developmental psychology at University of California, Davis. She works with Lisa Oakes in the Infant Cognition Lab. Michaela's research explores how infants learn to control their visual attention and what factors affect how infants look at the bustling world around them. She uses many different types of lab-based methodology to explore these questions ranging from automatic eyetracking to motor development assesments in both cross-sectional and large-scale longitudinal contexts.
